# StudentPerformance-ML
Predicting student mathematics performance using machine learning models and identifying key academic predictors.

### Overview

This project investigates whether machine learning models can accurately predict **student Mathematics scores** using prior academic performance and school-related metadata, and which subjects influence math outcomes the most.

I worked with a dataset of **16,824 student records** from schools in **Halabja** across five academic years (2018–2023), containing grades in multiple subjects and basic academic metadata.

The project compares **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**, and uses **feature importance analysis** to understand which subjects are most strongly linked to Mathematics performance.
